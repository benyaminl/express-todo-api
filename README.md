# Express JS Todo API

This is experimental Todo API using express, with some ejs (for simple web form to see the data), with some of the API using JSON. This Code upgraded using .ts, a little bit slow to compile, but strict type writting. 

## Dependency
 - ejs
 - body-parses
 - multer
 - sequelize

## Host Dependency 
 - ts-node

## How to Run 

```
nodemon index.ts
```

## How to Migrate 

```
ts-node models/migrate.ts
```

## Why request model?

It's for autocomplete, as it's like in .NET. Use predictable, clean code...
